## Github PR resource (WIP)

Concourse resource for Github Pull Requests written in Go and based on the [Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/object/commit/).
Using [the original](https://github.com/jtarchie/github-pullrequest-resource) as inspiration, but will
be made for use with webhooks, and hopefully be a bit simpler/bare bones than the original.

## Source Configuration

- `repository`: `owner/repository-name` this resource should target.
- `access_token`: A Github Access Token with repository access (required for setting status on commits).
- `path`: Only produce new versions if the PR includes changes to files that match a [path.Match](https://golang.org/pkg/path/#Match) pattern.
- `ignore_path`: Inverse of the above.
- `disable_ci_skip`: Disable ability to skip builds with `[ci skip]` and `[skip ci]` in commit message.

## Behaviour

#### `check`

Produces new versions for all commits (after the last version) ordered by the push date.
A version is represented as follows:

- `pr`: The subject ID of the pull request.
- `commit`: The subject ID of the last commit on the Pullrequest.
- `pushed`: Timestamp of when the commit was pushed (and webhook triggered). Used to filter subsequent checks.

If several commits are pushed to a given PR at the same time, the last commit will be the new version.

#### `get`

Clones the base (e.g. `master` branch) at the latest commit, and merges the pull request at the specified commit
into master. This ensures that we are both testing and setting status on the exact commit that was requested in
input. Because the base of the PR is not locked to a specific commit in versions emitted from `check`, a fresh
`get` will always use the latest commit in master and *report the SHA of said commit in the metadata*.

Note that, should you retrigger a build in the hopes of testing the last commit to a PR against a newer version of
the base, Concourse will reuse the volume (i.e. not trigger a new `get`) if it still exists, which can produce
unexpected results (#5). As such, re-testing a PR against a newer version of the base is best done by *pushing an 
empty commit to the PR*.

#### `put`

- `path`: The name given to the resource in a GET step.
- `status`: *Optional*: One of `SUCCESS`, `PENDING`, `FAILURE` and `ERROR`.
- `context`: *Optional*: A context to use for the status. (Prefixed with `concourse-ci`, defaults to `concourse-ci/status`).
- `comment`: *Optional*: A comment to add to the pull request.
- `comment_file`: *Optional*: Path to file containing a comment to add to the pull request (e.g. output of `terraform plan`).

Note that `comment` and `comment_file` will be added as separate comments.

## Costs

The Github API(s) have a rate limit of 5000 requests per hour (per user). This
resource will incur the following costs:

- `check`:
  - Minimum 1, max 1 per 100th open pull request.
  - When using `path`/`ignore_path`: Minimum 1 request per *new* commit, more if the commit contains more than 100 changed files.
  - NOTE: From my experiments it seems like requests to the V3 API does not count toward the rate limit of the V4 API and vice versa.
- `in`: Fixed cost of 2. Fetches PR and commit from ID.
- `out`: Minimum 1, max 3 (1 per `status`, `comment` and `comment_file`).

## Example

The following (incomplete) example would build a new AMI using Packer:

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: pull-request
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: itsdalmo/github-pr-resource

resources:
- name: test-repository-pr
  type: pull-request 
  source:
    repository: itsdalmo/test-repository
    access_token: ((github-access-token))
    context: concourse-ci/status

jobs:
- name: test-pr
  plan:
  - get: test-repository-pr
```
